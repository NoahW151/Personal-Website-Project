        <p>Hello there! I'm Noah. I've been interested in programming for a long time. I first started delving into the world of computer code around the age of 9. I wanted to learn how to make games after playing old flash games. My dad happened to have a book on HTML in the garage and I started learning from there. I ended up putting a pause on web development after the release of minecraft. Minecrafts mods seemed so cool to me and I needed to know how to make them. And so, I started the journey of learning Java.</p>
